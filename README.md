# Advancing Arrhythmia Detection in Micro ECG through CNN
- **Objective:** This project aims to develop a classification model utilizing a 1D-CNN architecture to automate the categorization of ECG signals into five distinct classes: Normal Beat, Supraventricular ectopic beats, Ventricular ectopic beats, Fusion Beats, and Unknown Beats.

- **Significance:** Manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and error-prone, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. Automated classification can greatly assist healthcare professionals in accurate and efficient diagnosis, addressing the critical need for effective arrhythmia detection.

- **Model Innovation:** The project introduces a modified 12-layer deep one-dimensional CNN, addressing the limitations of traditional CNN methodologies while maintaining high classification accuracy. This innovation ensures enhanced efficiency, making it suitable for analyzing micro ECG data.

- **Micro-Classification Focus:** The study delves into micro-classification, targeting discrete cardiac contractions such as Normal rhythm, Left Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Atrial Premature contractions, and Premature Ventricular Contraction anomalies. This approach addresses subtle nuances within ECG signals often overlooked in previous research.

- **Noise Reduction:** The project incorporates a wavelet-driven self-adaptive threshold methodology to meticulously eliminate noise from raw ECG signals, establishing a clean foundation for rigorous analysis.

- **Resource Constrained Deployment:** In recognition of the need for resource-efficient solutions, the project aims to strike a balance between diagnostic precision and computational efficiency. This dual-pronged strategy facilitates the deployment of the model on edge computing devices.

- **Impact:** By combining advanced signal processing techniques with innovative neural network design, this project aspires to significantly improve the precision and efficiency of arrhythmia diagnosis, offering a potential breakthrough in the field of cardiovascular healthcare.
